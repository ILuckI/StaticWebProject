            <p>Hello! </br>
                My name is Lukas, and I'm IT technician by profession but a programmer by passion. For over 2 years I
                have been designing and creating smaller or larger websites.
                I feel comfortable writing in web technologies such as Html, Css.
                I am eager to learn new techniques and programming languages,
                and now I'm full well JavaScript and training Java in stationary at school.
                On my blog I will describe progress in the 7-month training with Java and later adventures with finding
                a first job. Maybe working as a junior would be a good material for a blog?
                We see, while I encourage you to read my blog:)<br><br>If you have questions or ideas
